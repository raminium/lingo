# Lingo
## Abstract
This is a SPA version of the dutch television game Lingo. It is translated into three languages and offers own sets of words for each. For more details about the game: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingo_(Dutch_game_show))

## Technologies
 - React
 - Jest, Enzyme
 - Bootstrap
 - Node, Express

## Set Up
Until now you would need a server that serves five letter words to the application. (I will upload mine soon)

To install use `npm install` to install the needed npm modules.

### Client

To start client and server you need to seperately use `npm start`. For the client a browser window  with the application will open.

To run the tests you can use the `npm test` command in each subdirectory.

## Kudos
This project is built on the client side with create-react-app. It is based on test driven development practices taught by Bonnie Schulkin.
